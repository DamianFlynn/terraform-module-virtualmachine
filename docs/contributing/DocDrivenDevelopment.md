# Update the documentation

We recommend updating the documentation *before* updating any code (see [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)). This ensures the documentation stays up to date and allows you to think through the problem at a high level before you get lost in the weeds of coding.
